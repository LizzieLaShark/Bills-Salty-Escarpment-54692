What do you want to get better at?



Description

A description of your project
My project is a non-partisan online app with the purpose of making engagement in the political process easier for everyday kiwis.

Users will log in and be able to see what bills are currently being passed through
select committee. User will scroll through, click on bills that interest them
and be presented with a small summary of the bill and it's proposed changes.
User will be able to submit online and also click further for more information
and to be connected with NGO's and community groups who might be liaising or campaigning
on the bill.

If the user does go on to submit, they will be given the option of being kept in the loop
with what's going on with that bill. They'll be sent fortnightly news updates and will
be informed immediately when select committee meetings are scheduled or changed. They'll
be notified when the consultation closes and when outcome report is released.

Technologies

What technologies are you going to play with

-Most of it will involve scraping, mainly because I was unable to find any govt API that
contained useful information.

-I'll be using this opportunity to develop my css knowledge

-I imagine that the app will be quite slow, as such I hope to find technologies that can
help speed things up!


Milestones

What milestones and timeline do you want to commit to

I hope to have a good-looking, functional MVP to present by the end of phase two. If the idea gets some pick up among friends and access to govt data doesn't impede me too much, I may decide to work further on it.
